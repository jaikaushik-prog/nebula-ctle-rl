# PREDICTIONS — written before the run, kept whether or not they hold

**The rule.** Any experiment whose result could be argued for after the fact
gets a prediction committed to git **before** it runs. The commit timestamp is
the evidence. A failed prediction is a result and stays in this file with the
outcome written next to it; nothing here is ever edited to match what happened.

Precedent, from before this file existed:

* **G40** — the project's designated "strongest single sentence" (S3 is a
  coupled constraint) was falsified by the measurement that was supposed to
  confirm it. Retracted in `BOUNDS_REDERIVATION.md` §4.
* **10b's f_p2 prediction** — "the peak of a 1-zero/2-pole response sits near
  f_p2, so `cl` = 50 fF must give zero S3 yield." Measured: 8.73 %. Recorded in
  `CL_SENSITIVITY.md` §3 rather than quietly dropped, and it is the reason the
  analytic pre-screen is not expected to be a one-liner.

## 1. `cl` as a screened context range — the corner-and-load-robust yield

**Written:** 2026-08-06, session 12, **before** `s9_yield.py` was changed to
screen over `cl` and before it was re-run.
**Experiment:** `python -m nebula.experiments.s9_yield --n 2000` with the
screen set extended to 3 corners × {`cl_lo`, `cl_hi`} = 6 evaluations per
design, promotion to 45 corners × {`cl_lo`, `cl_mid`, `cl_hi`}, using
`CL_RANGE.md`'s **`cl_lo` = 13.64 fF, `cl_mid` = 32.63 fF, `cl_hi` =
78.04 fF** (ratio 5.72×, 2.52 octaves).

### The owner's stated expectation

> *"I expect the yield to land between the 8.73 % swept figure and the 13.54 %
> pinned one."*

### My prediction: **it lands far below that, at essentially zero.**

**Point estimate: 0 / 1890 = 0.00 %**, Wilson 95 % [0.00, 0.20 %].
Consistent-with-my-reasoning band: **0 to 10 designs (0.00–0.53 %)**.

Reasoning, entirely from already-published numbers — no new simulation was run
to produce it:

1. **S3's f_peak window is exactly one octave** (1.25–2.5 GHz), and the
   derived `cl` range is **2.52 octaves**.
2. **f_peak moves as roughly `cl^-0.5`.** Two independent supports.
   *Measured:* `CL_SENSITIVITY.md` §2's probe moved one sample's f_pk
   9.55 → 6.61 → 5.50 → 3.16 GHz across `cl` = 50/100/150/500 fF; the log-log
   slope is **−0.48**. *Structural:* if the peak of the 1-zero/2-pole response
   sits near the geometric mean of f_p1 and f_p2, and only f_p2 depends on
   `cl`, the exponent is exactly **−0.5**. The two agree to 4 %.
3. **So a 5.72× spread in `cl` moves f_peak by 5.72^0.5 = 2.39×, i.e. 1.26
   octaves** — 26 % *wider* than the entire window it has to stay inside.
   A design centred in the window at `cl_mid` is 0.63 octaves from centre at
   each edge, against a half-width of 0.50.
4. **The escape route is closed by the physics.** A design could survive if its
   own f_peak were less `cl`-sensitive than `cl^-0.5`, which needs f_p2 far
   above the peak. But a 1-zero/1-pole response has no interior maximum at all
   — it plateaus — so f_p2 is what *creates* the peak. Pushing f_p2 away weakens
   or extinguishes the peak instead (session 9c, and `CL_SENSITIVITY.md` §7's
   hump-shaped peak count), which fails S3's other axis.
5. **The corner tax then applies on top**, at ~0.61× per `S9_YIELD.md` §4,
   to a number that is already near zero.

So the load spread, not the corner spread, is predicted to be the binding
mechanism — by a wide margin. **I expect this experiment to disagree with the
stated expectation, and to disagree in the direction of much lower.**

### Supporting predictions, all for the same run

| # | quantity | prediction |
|---|---|---|
| 1a | 3-corner yield at `cl_lo` **alone** (13.6 fF) | **2–5 %** — below the 8.20 % measured at 150 fF, because a small load pushes f_p2 and the peak *up*, out through S3's 2.5 GHz top edge |
| 1b | 3-corner yield at `cl_hi` **alone** (78 fF) | **5–8 %**, i.e. closer to the 150 fF figure but still under it |
| 1c | TT / 27 °C at **both** `cl` edges | **0–15 designs (0–0.8 %)**, against 13.49 % at the 150 fF pin. The load spread bites at nominal PVT too; corners are not what kills this |
| 1d | binding constraint, pooled | `S3_f_peak` share **rises above 45 %** (it is 42 % at 150 fF), and it becomes more dominant at `cl_lo` than at `cl_hi` |
| 1e | promotion tier | **empty, or ≤ 10 designs.** If non-empty, ≥ 90 % of promoted designs survive all 45 corners × 3 loads — G47's screen-exactness result should carry over |
| 1f | `S5_noise` / `S6_power` | still never the first failure. `cl` does not touch either |

### What would falsify the reasoning (as opposed to the number)

* A yield of a few percent **with** a measured per-design f_peak sensitivity
  materially weaker than `cl^-0.5` for a sizeable subpopulation. That would
  mean step 2 is wrong and the geometric-mean model of f_peak does not hold
  across the box — which would be a more interesting result than the yield.
* A yield near zero but for the **wrong reason** — e.g. dominated by
  `S3_peaking` or `saturation` rather than by `S3_f_peak`. The prediction is
  specifically that the *window* is what cannot be held, and 1d is the check.

### Planned follow-up, pre-registered so it is not a post-hoc rescue

If the screen yields **≤ 5 designs**, "0 %" on its own is not a useful number,
so the run will additionally report — from the six evaluations it already
makes, at no extra simulation cost — the counts passing all three corners at
`cl_lo` only, at `cl_hi` only, and at both. If those disjoint sets are large,
the honest statement is *"the CTLE can be made corner-robust at either load,
but not at both"*, and the quantitative follow-up is **the widest `cl` ratio,
centred on `cl_mid`, at which a non-zero corner-robust yield survives** —
measured on the union of the two sets only, which is cheap. That converts a
0 % into a specification: *how tightly the load must be pinned down before this
topology can be signed off.*

### Outcome

*(to be filled in after the run — prediction and outcome side by side,
whichever way it goes)*
